The hypothesis is that organoid stress induces local and/or global transformations in the gene expression profile of neuronal subtypes such that direct comparison of gene expression profiles of cell subtypes collected directly from human cortical areas are not suitable to classify cell subtypes. We believe that cell classes and subtypes are still present in organoids, and that their classes and subtypes are recoverable after applying some registration/deformation/regression
